        //but here is one of few places in diversity where you have to use Objective C thing
        //Thats because we are specifying the actual class here NSURL.self

    }
    // So this is saying we can handle a drag like  that

        session.loadObjects(ofClass: UIImage.self) { (images) in

 //Why did I just dont make emojiArtView the dropZone?
    /*
     Well that's because of 2 reasons
     (1) I need to keep track of at the controller level what's dropped in because I am actually  going to rememer the URL of what's dropped in ,
     And all the keeping tracking of the document has to happen in controller level
     we dont want view doing that
     (2) Sometimes I am going to eventually put this view in scrollView and it might be small it might not be filling the space anymore and so I want the drop zone to be as big as possible
     So when I drop stuff in , it always works
     So that's why I need those separate but it's not really that big a deal not really  that much of a requirement to do it
     I didn't want you to think there's some special reason like you have to make your drop zone be a separate generic View  you dont have to

//Ctrl + shift + left click for menu of list of items in a viewcontrollers in storyboard


// bigger images takes longer time as it fetches the image asynchronously
//put a spinning wheel when we have gonna off to fetch that image
